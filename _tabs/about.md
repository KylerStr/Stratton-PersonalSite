Hi, Iâ€™m **Kyler Stratton** â€” a Systems Administrator and Automation Engineer with a passion for building efficient, scalable solutions. I specialize in managing complex **hybrid Azure GCCH environments** across multiple tenants and countries, ensuring seamless integration and compliance.

With years of experience in IT infrastructure, Iâ€™ve led a team of developers to design and implement automation strategies that streamline operations, reduce manual workload, and improve system reliability. My work spans across:

- **Cloud & Hybrid Administration**: Managing Azure, Microsoft 365, and on-premises environments.  
- **Automation & Scripting**: Extensive expertise in **PowerShell**, designing robust scripts and modules to automate compliance, monitoring, and deployment processes.  
- **Power Platform**: Leveraging Power Automate, Power BI, and Azure integrations for data-driven insights.  
- **Team Leadership**: Mentoring and guiding a technical team to deliver projects efficiently.  

Iâ€™m especially passionate about **PowerShell automation**, where Iâ€™ve built solutions that reduce repetitive tasks, improve consistency across environments, and support enterprise-scale operations.

When Iâ€™m not working in the IT space, youâ€™ll often find me experimenting with new automation projects, exploring emerging cloud technologies, or sharing solutions on my [GitHub](https://github.com/KylerStr). I also like to explore unusual ideas within the coding space. Such as building a voice activated AI assistant that leverages Chat GPT fully within PowerShell.
